o Version 1.1.0 06/28/2019:
  -------------------------

  New functionality available with 1.1.0 includes support for simulating
  transport with MODFLOW 6-generated flow-transport link files.  The new
  functionality works with native MODFLOW 6 output and does not require a 
  dedicated package (i.e., "LMT") to create an MT3D-USGS ready flow-transport
  link file.  New source code files required for compiling MT3D-USGS ver 1.1.0
  include: 
  
    - fmi1mf6.f
    - mf6bud.f90
    - mf6grb.f90
  
  Functionality included in mf6bud.f90 and mf6grb.f90 comes directly from
  MODFLOW 6 source files with some minor modification. Please refer to the 
  section titled "Notes on FT6 Option Starting with Version 1.1.0" in the 
  input instructions document contained with the 'doc' folder of the 
  distribution files for further instruction regarding the model input 
  changes required to take advantage of this functionality.
  

  Bug Fixes:
  
    - Fixed floating-invalid error in SSM1OT (ssm1.f)
    - Fixed wrongful reporting of mass lost to ET when the DRYCELL keyword
      is used in BTN.  Occured when user specified non-zero value of CINACT

  Other:
    
    - Added a comment to reflect that the ICBCSF flag is currently inactive
      in sft1.f 
    - Time interpolation added for TVD in adv1.f
    - Changes to the github auto-testing framework suggested by Mike Toews
      were adopted.
  
  Documentation:
  
    - Added new section to the input instructions describing how to invoke
      reading of MODFLOW 6-generated link files for simulating transport 
      with a structed MODFLOW 6 grid.
    - Minor clean-up of LKT input instructions
    - Corrected mis-statement in LMT8.pdf regarding how the LMT package
      should be activated in the MODLFOW name file

o Version 1.0.1 02/28/2019:
  -------------------------
  
  No new functionality added in 1.0.1.  Code changes primarily reflect bug
  fixes found by users and by the developers.  The most significant change
  users will notice is that the keyword "UZT" is no longer supported in the
  MT3D-USGS name file.  Instead, users are now required to use "UZT2" in 
  place of "UZT".  The removal of two 3D arrays from the UZT input file, 
  starting water content and starting saturated thickness, have resulted in
  this change.  These two quantities are now back-calculated based on values 
  passed via the linker file, alleviating the need to calculate them prior 
  to running MT3D-USGS.  Because this change does not facilitate backward 
  compatibility, the "UZT2" requirement ensures that the user is made aware 
  of this change so that appropriate adjustments are made to the UZT input 
  (i.e., the starting water content and starting saturated thickness are 
  removed from the UZT input file).
  

  Bug Fixes:
  
    - Removed IATS variable from list of variables at the beginning of BTN
      input file
    - Increased the fix-format write of HSS from I4 to I6 in HSS package
    - Cycle in UZT routine when IUZFBND = 0 (inactive)
    - Fixed format statement when reading SFT terms from linker file
    - Added the steady-state flag variable (iSSTrans) to dual domain problems
    - Cleaned-up various typos written to output files
    - Cleaned-up various typos contained within source code comments
    - Added check for negative cell thicknesses in BTN
    - Code added to ADV for handling the condition when solute from dry cell
      enters a constant concentration boundary. This fix also requiured
      appropriate terms be added to the budget summary
    - Variable THETAW was not primed with appropriate values in RCT
      when ISOTHM=1
    - Fixed bug related to the refilling of IA/JA arrays for SFT calculation
      for each flow step
    - Fixed bug that didn't properly account for mass leaving the groundwater
      system as discharge to land surface
    - Fixed bug that mishandled the case when using UZT as a boundary
      condition to the groundwater system (i.e., no routing of solute
      through the unsaturated zone)
    - Tidied up variable declarations in ADV for streamlined calls to CFACE
      and SADV1U
    - Reversed the order of some DO loops in GCG to work with Fortran's
      row-major array ordering
    - Fixed 2 instances of where DELR(I) shoudl be DELR(J) in adv
      pertaining to the CMAS2 calculation
    - Fixed bug related to specified mass-loading sources for when the
      saturated thickness gets small and results in really large QSS terms
      owing to QSS = 1/VOLAQU
    - Fixed bug that misread IREACTION variable in RCT and lead to the
      miscalculation of retardation when using a linear isotherm
    - Added the ability to handle multi-species in SFT.  Added species
      (ICOMP) index to CNEWSF variable
    - Fixed bug that was using the wrong reader in UZT1AR(), switched out
      U2DINT with IARRAY reader
    - Fixed bug in zeroth-order decay calculations leading to negative
      concentrations
    - Fixed bug in UZT that was using the wrong porosity value when TVD
      active, added some associated checks to code
    - Fixed bug in FMI and SSM related to proper initialization of UZT-
      related terms
    - Fixed bug that failed to enforce the activation of SSM if only using
      SFT, LKT, and/or UZT.  Code exits with appropriate error message if
      SSM isn't turned on and 1 or more these package are all that is active
    - Fixed a bug related to compound "if" statements in SSM.  Broke
      compound if statement in to 2, or nested, if statements.
    - Fixed a bug that improperly reset constant concentration boundary
      condition in SSM
    - Fixed a bug that resulted in the mis-calculation of the mass balance
      when TVD and adsorption were both being used
    - Initialize velocity component array
    - Fix format label mismatches in adv1.f and ssm1.f
  
  Other:     
  
    - Altered default threshold for checking if a cell is dry in CTS
      package.  Threshold changed from 1e-5 to 1e-8
    - Added "implicit none" to GCG function
    - Split UZT to SFT stream budget terms in standard output file. This
      transfer of mass between packages now differentiates "GW Discharge"
      from "Rejected Recharge"
    - In ADV, changed 2 common block variables related to MOC option to
      module calls
    - Removed IREACT=90, 91 from RCT; these were part of legacy code needed
      for first version of MT3D-USGS - no longer needed
    - Switched from implicit to explicit variable assignment of water content
      in UZT
    - Added auto-detection of single vs double precision in FMI that does
      not require the use of external library dependencies.  Previous
      commits attempted to use IFLPORT library that crashed gfortran
      compilers
    - Removed specification of starting water content and saturated thickness
      arrays from the UZT input file.  It is possilbe to back calculate these
      values from the change in storage and thicksat arrays passed in the
      linker file.  Code now requires use of UZT2 in name file to prevent
      users from mistakenly proceeding with these arrays present
    - Ensure fixed-width source is <= 72 chars
  
  Documentation:
  
    - Documention of IUZFBND more clearly states what's expected
    - Various typos
    - When IUZFBND < 0, UZF terms are handled by SSM as a boundary condition
      Made an entry in SSM for this condition
    - Cleaned up input instructions for LKT


o Version 1.0.0 09/30/2016:
  ------------------------

MT3D-USGS version 1.0.0 is built upon MT3DMS version 5.3 and includes
many new capabilities described in the manual available found in the doc
directory.
