1) CDRY: Vivek defines this variable as CHARACTER*3, but it is already defined as REAL in the 'modules' version.
2) Not sure why INCTS/6/ & INTSO/14/ are not set in congruence with other NameTRNOP slots in Vivek's version?
   yet INRTR/15/, INLKT/16/, INSFT/17/ are set as is the custom.
   
TO DO (Items skipped):
1) In Vivek's code: Main program; lines 170-183
2) In Vivek's code: Main program; lines 230-243
3) In Vivek's code: Main program; lines 269-271 (quoted next 3 lines):
      IF(iUnitTRNOP(6).GT.0)
     & ALLOCATE(CEXT2CTS(NCOMP),CGW2CTS(NCOMP),CADDM(NCOMP),
     & CCTS2EXT(NCOMP),CCTS2GW(NCOMP),CREMM(NCOMP))
   These lines of code should be added to the CTS package
4) In Vivek's code: Main program; lines 869-872 Need to add this to the MEMDEALLOCATE function call rather than
   have it be its own thing.
5) In Vivek's code: BTN module; MINVOL isn't used anywhere and should probably be removed.
6) In Chris's translation of the code: RCT module; line 222 says "CLANGEVIN--NEED TO OPEN UCN2 FILES HERE INSTEAD OF IN BTN5AR"
   Needs to be dealt with, ask Chris if he's addressed it yet.
7) Check to make sure that some of Vivek's new material (For example, in SADV5U, make sure that DH
   used by Vivek will work with the UZF material.
8) Clean up function calls to SADV5Q3, NODE2KIJ, ADVQC7RP, ADVQC7BD, ADVQC7FM, SADV5Q2 in ADV package.
   That is 
9) Functions READSFR & READLAK have not been converted into the modules format quite yet.
10) In FMI, check to make sure that the code around line 648 is playing nicely with each other
    (it is a mix of Vivek and UZF code).
11) On about line 336 of the main module, the following code: "CNEW=COLD" should be reviewed
