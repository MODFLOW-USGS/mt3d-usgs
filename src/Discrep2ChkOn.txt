1) CDRY: Vivek defines this variable as CHARACTER*3, but it is already defined as REAL in the 'modules' version.
  - CHARACTER definition of CDRY deleted from the main file mt3d-usgs.f 1/7/2016
2) Not sure why INCTS/6/ & INTSO/14/ are not set in congruence with other NameTRNOP slots in Vivek's version?
   yet INRTR/15/, INLKT/16/, INSFT/17/ are set as is the custom.
  - this has already been addressed in the code. 1/7/2016
TO DO (Items skipped):
1) In Vivek's code: Main program; lines 170-183
  - Not sure what these line numbers refer to as the lines may have moved from the time that this comment was made.
2) In Vivek's code: Main program; lines 230-243
3) In Vivek's code: Main program; lines 269-271 (quoted next 3 lines):
      IF(iUnitTRNOP(6).GT.0)
     & ALLOCATE(CEXT2CTS(NCOMP),CGW2CTS(NCOMP),CADDM(NCOMP),
     & CCTS2EXT(NCOMP),CCTS2GW(NCOMP),CREMM(NCOMP))
   These lines of code should be added to the CTS package
  - this has already been addressed in the code. 1/7/2016
4) In Vivek's code: Main program; lines 869-872 Need to add this to the MEMDEALLOCATE function call rather than
   have it be its own thing.
  - Not sure what this means.
5) In Vivek's code: BTN module; MINVOL isn't used anywhere and should probably be removed.
  - this has already been addressed in the code. 1/7/2016
6) In Chris's translation of the code: RCT module; line 222 says "CLANGEVIN--NEED TO OPEN UCN2 FILES HERE INSTEAD OF IN BTN5AR"
   Needs to be dealt with, ask Chris if he's addressed it yet.
  - this has already been addressed in the code. 1/7/2016
  - commented was deleted now. 1/7/2016
7) Check to make sure that some of Vivek's new material (For example, in SADV5U, make sure that DH
   used by Vivek will work with the UZF material.
  - I remember seeing this with Eric. I believe this was addressed long back. Eric can you confirm? 1/7/2016
8) Clean up function calls to SADV5Q3, NODE2KIJ, ADVQC7RP, ADVQC7BD, ADVQC7FM, SADV5Q2 in ADV package.
   That is 
  - Not sure what this means.
9) Functions READSFR & READLAK have not been converted into the modules format quite yet.
  - Looks like this was addressed. 1/7/2016
10) In FMI, check to make sure that the code around line 648 is playing nicely with each other
    (it is a mix of Vivek and UZF code).
  - the line numbers have probably moved, but I think Eric and I had taken care of this. Eric?
11) On about line 336 of the main module, the following code: "CNEW=COLD" should be reviewed    
  - Looks like this was addressed. 1/7/2016
