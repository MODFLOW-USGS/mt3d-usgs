This is the place to put comparison tests.  A comparision tests will most likely have a .cmp folder within it.  Autotest will then compare the results from the simulation with the files in the .cmp folder.  So if the model produces prob7.lst and MT3D001.UCN, then the .cmp folder should have prob7.lst and MT3D001.UCN.cmp within it.
