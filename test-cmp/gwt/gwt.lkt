#NLAKES: number of lakes
#MXLKBC: MAXIMUM NUMBER OF LAKE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
#ICBCLK: LAKE-BY-LAKE INFORMATION WILL BE PRINTED ON UNIT
#IETLK:  0 = MASS DOES NOT EXIT VIA LAKE ET; 1 = MASS IS ALLOWED TO EXIT VIA LAKE ET

#IREAD = unit number (leave @ 103 for now, this is free format)
#CONSTANT = leave @ 1 for now
#FMTIN = array input format
#IPRN = see MT3DMS documentation for a list of these codes, I can't remember them all right now.
